Hello potential entire world! This is my first project on The Odin Project with directions to create a simple food website with links to specific recipes. This product is intended to showcase the introduction HTML knowledge I have obtained on my early journey to becoming a Full-Stack developer. This journey shall be long and arduous, much like the journey young Frodo and Sam took to destroy the One Ring. One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all, And in the Darkness bind them. I applaud and appreciate you being here fine citizen.
